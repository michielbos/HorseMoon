Ahh... nice little forest I accidentally bought a farm near.
Wonder if anyone'll care if I name it. It's next to my farm, after all.
Satchel Forest? NI, too self-indulgent.
Satch Thicket? Still self-indulgent, but sounds fancier.
Say... what's that on the other side of the river?
Golly... I've never seen so many flowers. Not even in that real big flower shop back home.
Shame the bridge across the river's broken. It'd be real nice to bring [$satchelTenderNickname] here...
Y'know what? I should repair this bridge myself.
She's been advising me on how to fix this place up... she sure would be surprised if I did this myself.
And I bet she'd really like the flowers here... spending time here...
That's decided then! I'll fix the bridge, bring [$satchelTenderNickname] over here, and she'll love me!
Uh, it! It! Is... what I meant to say.
... Is it?
