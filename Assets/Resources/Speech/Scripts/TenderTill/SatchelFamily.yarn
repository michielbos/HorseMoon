Hey, could I ask you a question?

<<speaker Satchel>>
You just did.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
Could I ask you another one?

<<speaker Satchel>>
You just did.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
Could... ugh!

<<speaker Satchel>>
Heh... go on then.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
Alright... so, what's your family like?

<<speaker Satchel>>
My family? Why do you ask?

<<speaker TenderTill>>
Just making small talk! You're fun to talk to, and I want to know more about you.

<<speaker Satchel>>
Not really a whole lot to say on the matter, to be honest.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
Did you have a bad relationship with them or something?

<<speaker Satchel>>
Oh, no. Not exactly.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
But kind of?

<<speaker Satchel>>
I love them and they love me, but we just don't see eye to eye on some things.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
Like what?

<<speaker Satchel>>
Me doing this, for instance.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
Riiight, you did mention something about that before.

<<speaker Satchel>>
Mhm.
Mom runs a big clothing business in Canterlot. Sells to all the bigwigs in town.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
And your father?

<<speaker Satchel>>
Dad does the designing. Princess Luna even wore one of his dresses once.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
That's amazing!

<<speaker Satchel>>
Mhm.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
So what's the problem?
You've got an entrepreneurial spirit like your mom, and the urge to do the handiwork yourself like your dad.

<<speaker Satchel>>
Really wish they saw it the way you did.
This is commoner's work to them. They think I should be representing their brand with them.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
Wow...
We're more alike than I thought, I guess.

<<speaker Satchel>>
Heh... reckon so.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
For the record, I think you're doing a great job here.
And I think it's admirable to go out and do your own thing when you could have had a fast track to success in a field you
didn't want to be involved in.

<<speaker Satchel>>
Well... thanks, [$satchelTenderNickname]. I really appreciate it.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
No problem! If you have any more problems, feel free to tell good old [$satchelTenderNickname] all about them!

<<speaker Satchel>>
Yeah... I think I will.
