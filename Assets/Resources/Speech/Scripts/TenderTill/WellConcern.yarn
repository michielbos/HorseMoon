Hey there, [$satchelTenderNickname]! You okay? You look kinda distracted.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
Oh yeah, I'm great! Just thinking about something.

<<speaker Satchel>>
What's on your mind? Anything I can help with?

<<speaker TenderTill>>
You're always so helpful!

<<speaker Satchel>>
Is that what was on your mind?

<<speaker TenderTill>>
I think about stuff besides you, Mr. Ego!

<<speaker Satchel>>
I didn't mean...

<<speaker TenderTill>>
I'm messing with you, silly. But no, it's something else.

<<speaker Satchel>>
What then?

<<speaker TenderTill>>
How long has this well been sitting here like this?

<<speaker Satchel>>
Uhh... since before I took over? Don't rightly know the exact time.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
Well, why does it look like this?

<<speaker Satchel>>
Should I... should I paint it?

<<speaker TenderTill>>
You really <i>are</i> new to this, aren't you?

<<speaker Satchel>>
What's that supposed to mean?

<<speaker TenderTill>>
I'm just saying that you could probably save yourself some trips to the river if you repaired the well.

<<speaker Satchel>>
Oh! Uh... I knew that. I was just... testing you.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
Suuuure you were. It's okay if you didn't know. Good thing I'm here to keep you in check, huh?

<<speaker Satchel>>
Don't know what I'd do without ya.

<<speaker TenderTill>>
Keep saying that and I'll have to come over even more than I already do.

<<speaker Satchel>>
You're always welcome here, [$satchelTenderNickname].

<<speaker TenderTill>>
Awww.
